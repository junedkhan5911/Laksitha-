README: Sudoku Grid Validator (Clean & Ready)

Project Title: Sudoku Grid Validator

Project Description

This project validates whether a completed 9×9 Sudoku grid follows all Sudoku rules. It uses core C programming concepts such as loops, functions, pointers, and matrices. The program checks:

1. All rows contain the numbers 1–9 exactly once


2. All columns contain the numbers 1–9 exactly once


3. All 3×3 sub-grids contain the numbers 1–9 exactly once



If all checks pass → VALID SOLUTION
Otherwise → INVALID SOLUTION
